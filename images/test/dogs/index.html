            <h2>Beagle's</h2>
            <p>The Beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger <br> foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for hunting rabbit or hare, known as<br> beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the Beagle<br> is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and<br> foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is a popular pet due to its size<br> and good temper.</p>
